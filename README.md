# AI-Simulation-C-glm-
Coursework for a  module at The University of Hull containing AI and physics simulation made in C++ using glm library.

A physics-based Tower defence simulation for a module at the University done in C++ using the GLM library.
The agents(capsules) steer towards the tower to take control of them. Once they reach the tower they influence the tower into their own team-type colour. The tower then shoots only the opponent-coloured agents.
